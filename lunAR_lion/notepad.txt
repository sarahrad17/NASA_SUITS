Hey John's calling my pick up for me myself.

No.

So. Sorry.

This Saturday.
Since my Phone with him.
Why?
Yeah, I mean, Grant is not the same.
Then you just need to make more friends mom.
It's because you're not talking to people mom, you need to make friends.
Make meaningful relationships right now.
Hello.
Yeah.
Goodnight.
Yeah.
I know.
Yeah, it would be and if you have the?
More close friends I think it would be different too.
Yeah, but I think it would be better than nothing.
There are plenty of people who feel the same way that you do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Yep.
Yeah, so you should do something fun and make meaningful relationships and do cool things.
Right now.
I miss you too.
I really think you need to do something about this, though, because this is going to be going to undo.
And if you only know when she leaves are going to be really lonely.
I know.
I know it told you multiple times never to do that.

Then.
Yep.
Hello.
I know I said a lot of times that I don't think you should look at them.

Yes, because that's where he is.
Yes.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yep.
I do.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Long time.
I'm not fine. I still feel bad, but there's nothing you can do about it right now, so.
Yeah, I am.
Not really, but I never could.
No.
But.
I mean, I don't really care about.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Hello.
I'm excited to see him.
Yeah.
No yeah man.
I am
Oh yeah, yes.
I just don't feel good and I'm annoyed that I don't feel good.
Yeah.
I had multiple doctors tell me it's definitely not, that so.
Yeah, that wouldn't explain why I have floaters in my eyes and my vision changes.
Really?
Can you still have them at the same mine are always in the same place?
Mine are always in the same place or yours. Always in the same place.
Yeah, but like they're always in the same general.
But they're always, in like the same general area out of here.
Well, no it does 'cause I had a lot of them from my eyes were messed up.
Now, my vision store messed up that's why they want me to get the that's why they wanted me to get them are I'm on.
Just because my vision was messed up and I had floaters.
I hope it comes back fine. I'm also hoping they figure out what's wrong with my neck.

No, I don't do that anymore.
At my desk.
I don't know.
Not really heavy but it is heavier.
I mean, but everyone has black box.
Yes.
Hello.
I do only wear heels or twice a year.
Yeah.
How do you know?

Comma.
Maybe I'll just come back to Cincinnati separately or something.
Let me look at my calendar like not. I'll go to Columbus, too. But I'll just come back to Cincinnati for weekend because it's really not a big deal. As long as I'm working wherever I am.
Like it's not a huge deal with it.
I mean he could come down separately too. If you want and we can hang out long.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah, he does.
Yeah.
What if I come the weekend of February 21st?
It's like one of the few weekends road ownership cinestyle.
Yeah.
Person.
Is she going to be around at all, though like?
Like is she staying downtown.
Her she sleeping at home.
I mean that's fine.
Yeah, it's fine.
Yeah, I saw that actually.
Not.
I'm looking right now and it's $200.
Yeah.
Oh, just kidding it's 250.
Let me see if I can get one Thursday night.
Hey Cortana, cheaper
no it's not too bad.
So so.
I was trying.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah, it's like $250.
His name.
Spring break.
Hello.
Affected.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not all for the because in shambles.
They're just being very poorly managed.
By the people that.
Which is which isn't the peoples fault?
I guess.
Would you want me to come back? Should I look at tickets to come back or no?
Hello.
Yeah, it's fine.
Why?
I mean, I already have time with look up.
A lot of this semester, it's fine.
It's fine, it's fine.
Can I just send your flights?
I'm going to right now.
Can you get on?
I'm trying not to spend money on things in my bank account because I have a feeling that they're gonna get insurance companies gonna screw me and I don't know what to do about it.
Yeah.
Normal stressed about it.
I know, but I just don't know what to do 'cause I definitely competitive but it's fine.
Should I take a one thirty flight up to New York or 4:30 flight back to me.
Yeah.
I kinda wanna take 3:30, so I can take her 1:30 so I can take the bus back to.
OK, I just said it floats.
Jerking off.
You can buy it. Whenever you want. Let me check my calendar, one more time. But I'm pretty sure that I'm OK to go at 2 midterms. The day before, but no midterms. The next week. So I don't think it really matters.
Yeah, it looks fine.
The others.
Yeah, you need to do is make friends.
I know.
Yeah, I mean?
There.
I know, but sometimes it's nice to have friends just to talk to.
Like they don't have to be the best people.
Hey sorry my Phone is broken.
It's broken.
I can't click on anything.
So I tried to click on the speakerphone and so my Phone just shut down.
Oh yeah, Super Duper.
What can you do?
Instead of a what?
And then the airline flights $200 a new Phone will not be $200 but.
Yeah, I kind of do.
Because group chat culture.
Like.
So basically youth culture, you use like group chats in FaceTime and those are Apple specific so most people who use groupchats will not include you in a group chat if you don't have an iPhone because it won't allow you to Lake.
It's like.
It's not it doesn't work. If you don't have an iPhone essentially like the way that people could Chuck.
Yes.
So it basically means that you can't be in Group chats.
That's why young people have iPhones.
Yeah.
Expensive.
She going to crossroads about.
Go to crossroads event.
Will you do it for me?
Yeah.
I mean do you feel better?

It should still go to a doctor.
It kind of sounds like you have arthritis in your hip.
You should just go to the doctor.
I feel like I say this all the time.
Then do it tomorrow.
Trust me, yeah, I know.
But I'm still doing it because I know that I'm going to feel better at the end of it and you have so.
Like Yeah, but
not all the way.
Every time I go you know, those bills are not the only medical expenses on paying for this right every time I go? I have to pay 2.
A Co pay.
Think like 50 well depends on what I'm doing sometimes it's 30. Sometimes it's good to.
Like for every chiropractor appointment, I went to when I tried to fix my neck, it was 30.
Which wasn't bad but still annoying?
'cause, like that's a lot of money for me.
Like that's how much it cost me to like buy food for a week.
And everything is so expensive here like so let me hit it.
I mean, I don't know it's going to depend on how this stuff works out with bills like I'm not spending money on anything fun. Like I literally haven't done anything fun like tomorrow. I'm doing my first one thing all semester.
Yeah, but I don't get food, I get like snack or coffee.
Like I haven't spent more than like $10 on anything fun for me since I got here.
Maybe 5.
Tomorrow, I'm taking a class at Broadway dance center with Rachel Zimmerman, though, so that's like going to do something expensive in the funding for myself, I guess.
Yeah.
Oh no.
Speak.
Select I 1900.
Right now, yeah, I'm just I'm not likely is where I don't spend all the money that I have when I have it like?
Especially given the circumstances I'm in right now like I know I'm going to have to spend a lot of money soon.
OK.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Please don't live in my house, though.
I feel that letter asking him now.
Yeah.
I don't know.
OK.
OK.
It's OK.
You could be having like this could be part of something that's wrong with you know right.
That's what I'm saying like.

Should get a light?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

I mean, I'd like to be able to do fun things I feel like that's fair like I worked all summer.
The arms.
And also already paid my deposit for the apartment so.
I didn't tell him today yet.
I think I figured out what I want to do, though I mean, I haven't talked to my new Department about it yet, but I get out of school.
Probably my last final will be made 12.
And I want to do.
I want to like leave the next day, the 13th.
So that I can be home on the 15th.
And then I want to leave right away for Houston.
Hum from Cincinnati.
You can't find me down there 'cause, I need a car.
We should talk to grandpa about that also.
So what am I going to do.
Oh, she's gonna hear that mom, you can't do that.
I don't know what you really shouldn't do that.
OK, we'll figure it out when I get closer but.
So.
Yeah.
Stupid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She needs.
I feel like it.
That's not a bad idea.
Like that's a good idea.
But anyways I wish you would hate that but it's better than not having a car.
So I don't think she care.
So I want to leave New York and then spend one day in Cincinnati and then drive to Houston.
And then start work on that Monday.
So that I can work for 2 weeks and then fly home on the 29th for Liz's graduation.
Hum.
And be in Cincinnati that weekend and then come back for work.
Because if I start early in the year that I have more time at the end of the year.
Yeah, or at least be in Cincinnati, Oh or Columbus or something.
I just don't really want to be in like Houston when it starts getting to be like mid August.
You know.
Yeah, I kinda wanna just get out.
Like since I don't really think that that's where I want to work I would just rather not be there.
Like I'd rather get it over with, so yeah, that's why I'm trying to do it early.
Um.
Yeah.
So that's my plan right now.
Hello I just wanna stop by kind of liked it this side. It's
the Instant Academy of Science and technology in Madison.
Hello.
I have to go to Grad School, 1st but I kinda wanna go to grad school anyways so.
He just got yeah.
I don't want to do that, though.
Especially just from watching his experiences. I don't wanna do that.
I mean he was just a different person than him like he can't talk to anyone about what he does or like anything.
They like how he can't do anything like they drug test him every 2 years. They like put him through lie detector test every 5 years like he gets randomly searched and tested and stuff like I don't know it's just not really how I want to like.
Yeah.
Nope, that's not the point like it's more than that.
No, I just don't wanna have to go through that all the time.
Yeah, it would just stress me out.
Tough to do that ****.
It is good for me, but I don't really want to do it.
I don't know.
Hello.
Yeah.
I mean, it's too late for me to work somewhere else.
I don't know.
I don't really want to, but
or like I want to, but I don't think it's smart for me too.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.
What is up to see?
Where is this?
Hello.
Cute.
Yep.
Yeah, I mean, it's not hurtful like.
I mean, it's also not her fault if you were like married this would be fine.
If the amount of time that she talks to you like it's not.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying so like.
Don't have unrealistic expectations for her that's all.
Exactly.
I mean, yeah that's also true.
Yeah, I think so.
That's what I just said.
So.
Also I just said.
Yeah.
We should do that tonight.
If I go back to working now will you do it?
I should but I don't have to, if you need to talk if you only talking.
I don't feel like working out. I'm too, tired to workout this whole week.
Not this week I skipped my dance classes, too.
'cause I don't think I could do it.
I just don't feel good, I feel super tired.
And like dizzy every time I move I feel dizzy.
No.
They don't make me feel Dizzy Mom.

It's just not the problem. The doctors repeatedly told me that it's not the problem.
It's a massive strain on your body to stop taking them because then it has to readjust to know hormones, which is just as bad as it adjusting to hormones.
Yeah, you've made that clear.
I heard you.
Yeah, you also got knocked up so.
Are you still here?
Yeah.
No.
Yeah, I know.
I'm just saying, you definitely pay the price for it.
Hello.
Well, you have a whole different life, but
Yes,
yeah.
Yes.
Yeah, I know.
I'll ask my doctor.
Would you like me to do that I can do that?
All right.
Hello.
Yep.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I think about it.
Sure.
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah, I will.
Hello I'm not gonna feel it, I told her professors and they said it was fine.

I said, I'll think about it.
OK, I'll think about it.
I said, I'll think about it.

Alright we should pay for it.

If there's a device.
I think it's
what?
I think it's a good start I mean, I'm glad that she now has like bowling in time and resources like worry about these things like.
To worry about them to be honest.
Like she said that she says she's so tired when she comes home from where I should be less like she doesn't actually have the time for it.
I don't know she was like crying. I felt so bad. I don't know what to do.
We haven't been.
Nothing I'm good and I she was not good.
Now, she's good.
So.
Whatever.
Here, I go back to Cincinnati.
I might go back to Cincinnati, the weekend after you come here.

I was thinking, we could do lunch on Sunday maybe.
Lunch is in Hudson yards.
Play Saturday,
9.
I think it's at 8.
I was gonna say dinner before the play.
That's also good.
But it's that place is no it's not at all in the same area. That's why I was saying. If we want to go to that place we definitely need to do it a different time.
Dinner.
At dinner about the other shows it the show is Saturday at 8.

Hello.
Let's do it earlier so that we can walk around Hudson yards, well it's too bright out.

No, no, I was just saying it's gonna be dark outside when we're walking around so I don't think that.
You want to go there at 6:00 PM.

Can you stop and ask you a question I'm not?
You don't have to sass me, I'm just asking you when you wanted to go.

And walk around 7:00.
Is it? It's not but it gets dark here like 5?
In fact, 30, so it'll be.
It's not that nice also.
