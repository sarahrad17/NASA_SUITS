okay this is me trying to reconstruct what I did 
1) make sure you have node/npm and node/express installed on your system (install npm and run npm i node and then npm install express)
2) make sure you have simulate.js and suitswitch.js in a folder called models
3) run "node app.js", you should see time stamps printing (1s, 2s...etc) 
4) then navigate to "http://localhost:3000/api/suit" to see telemetry stream data 

**if you have problems at any of these steps let me know**
