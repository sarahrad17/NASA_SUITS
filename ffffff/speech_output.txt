Yeah, it works.
Go out and see Nancy.
Did you see the picture I sent? She's so cute.
No, I can see you, I will.
It's 8:00 o'clock. It's too late. You should text her happy birthday.
Good idea.
Oh, she's definitely not Native American.
Who?
Yeah.
Hello.
What goes down on her dress?
She is.
Do not even try, yeah.
Wish.
Hello, how they can't use English?

And went to Cambridge.
Cambridge or Oxford or whatever the operator.
No, she studied abroad. Yeah, like she had transferred there.
Who will look like a one year transfer program where you like doing here there?
Nah.
I mean, what are you can't with computer science usually?
Yeah.
Is there any trouble?
I mean, you can do semesters abroad, but I it's like bad if you want to do like.
Anything after college to do study abroad?
'cause you have to take good classes instead of ******** pass fail class is over since.
We
It's really not.
I don't know, I only know because people tell me so in my advisor.
No, it's because the classes offered there aren't as good.
Like you don't take hard classes there. You can't take your major classes so you won't be able to take any computer science classes.
So, like you're not helping in grad schools, only care about your major, right? So they don't care how you do it at home.
Hey.
Art home that's the problem. Colombia score classes are like pretty like Colombia specific, right? So like there's a summer program where you can take like art home in Paris or something. But like you have to pay for it though.
They pay for some of the reviews It cost, but you doctor right like it's like a whole thing.
You can try. I don't know. I think. I mean, you definitely can't actually, because you're doing Amazon.
Yeah, but you're not gonna wanna not work yourself or somewhere.
