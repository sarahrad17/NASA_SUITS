Alright, you can stop now.
Z.
Figure out.
More.
Really.
Material.
Save this for later.
While you give me.
And she still is.
Hello.

Start, but I want to hear about Bank of America at some point. Exactly what you guys discuss.
They don't know what the **** they're doing wrong. I'm telling you.
Will still pay you if there's no work, basically, which is what matters. Well, actually for you. I don't feel like you need money. What you need is the experience for resumes. Right now you don't have a job resume. Yeah, that's what I just said so.
I understand that, but like that's what you need, you just need something to get your foot in the door. 'cause like I had Robert working for Robert was the greatest thing. Yeah, I know, but it was a real job. So when I applied to other jobs, people were like you have work experience that's not working in a restaurant or babysitting.
What?
That's not working though, like it's like.
No, but what I'm saying is she needs a job that's like a real job like none of those are like you know what I mean.
And like on paper work I did with Rob look like a real job.
And I want it to be something it doesn't even have to be paid. It just doesn't look good on a resume. No? 'cause I took an unpaid internship over a paid internships my freshman summer because it matters what's on your resume.
Like it's better to have unpaid internship at a tech startup in the World Trade Center. Then it paid internship at a charity in Cincinnati.
